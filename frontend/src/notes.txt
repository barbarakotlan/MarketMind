• What did you do this week?

  This week I transformed MarketMind's Learning Center from a static page into a full interactive
  course platform with 26 chapters across 5 modules, complete with progress tracking, chapter-by-
  chapter navigation, keyboard shortcuts, and a floating action button for marking completion. I
  also cleaned up the backend by removing duplicate code and replacing print statements with prop
  er logging. Finally, I refined the UI by making completion indicators more subtle and ensuring
  the dark mode toggle stayed in the header rather than inside modules.

  What is your plan next week?

  Next week I plan to add quiz questions specific to each module to reinforce learning after chap
  ter completion. I'll also implement a certificate or badge system that users receive when they
  complete the entire course. Lastly, I'll add social sharing features so users can post their pr
  ogress and achievements to encourage engagement and attract new users to the platform.


• Backend (in a new terminal):

  cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python api.py

  Frontend (in a new terminal):

  cd frontend && npm start
