  What did you do this week?

  This week I enhanced the Prediction Markets feature with seven additions: an exchange switcher, market sorting and category filtering, a
  portfolio growth chart, 30-second auto-refresh,trading performance statistics, and a market watchlist with star bookmarking. I also created 
  a production deployment roadmap covering Clerk OAuth authentication, PostgreSQL migration, and Vercel/Render hosting.
  Additionally, I removed UI overscroll bounce in polishing the user experience of the interface.

  What is your plan next week?

  Next week I plan to replace the Help section with interactive learning modules that teach users how to read stock charts, understand options
  strategies, and interpret prediction market probabilities. I will begin implementing Clerk OAuth authentication on both the frontend and
  backend to enable multi-user support as outlined in our production roadmap. I also plan to refactor all hardcoded API URLs to environment
  variables and start the PostgreSQL database migration to prepare for production deployment.
